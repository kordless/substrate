# Substrate Write and Run Python Example

## Getting Started

To begin using this project, you'll need to obtain an API key from Substrate. Follow these steps to get started:

1. **Visit the Substrate API**: Navigate to the following URL to retrieve your API key:
   - [https://substrate.run](https://substrate.run)

2. **Input Your API Key**: Once you have your API key, you can input it into the application during startup when prompted.

## Running the Code

This project allows you to write and execute Python functions dynamically using the Substrate API. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **Function Creation**: You can create new functions by providing a description of what the function should do. The application will write the code for you.

2. **Executing Functions**: After defining the functions, you can run them directly from the command line interface. The application will prompt you to select which function to run.

3. **Dynamic Code Execution**: The code is executed using the Substrate API, allowing for seamless integration of new functionalities without needing to manually update the scripts.

### Example Usage
- To create a function, enter a description in the prompt when asked. The application will handle the rest, including writing the code and ensuring it runs without errors. 
- After the function is created, you will see an option to run it; simply follow the prompt to input any needed parameters.
